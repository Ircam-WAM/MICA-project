####Susan Alcorn
One of the world’s premiere musical innovators on her instrument, Baltimore-based Susan Alcorn has taken the pedal steel guitar far beyond its traditional role in country and western swing music. Known among steel guitarists for her virtuosity and authenticity in a traditional context, Alcorn first paid her dues in Texas country & western bands. Soon she began to expand the vocabulary of her instrument through her study of modern classical music (Messiaen, Varèse, Penderecki), the deep listening of Pauline Oliveros, Astor Piazzolla’s nuevo tango, free jazz, and world musics (Indian rags, South American songs, and gamelan orchestra). Her pieces reveal the complexity of her instrument and her musical experience while never straying from a very direct, intense, and personal musical expression. Though primarily a solo performer, Alcorn has collaborated with numerous artists including Pauline Oliveros, Evan Parker, Eugene Chadbourne, Peter Kowald, Chris Cutler, Ellen Fullman, Le Quan Ninh, Sean Meehan, Joe McPhee, LaDonna Smith, Mike Cooper, Jandek, Fred Frith, Maggie Nicols, and Mary Halvorson.

The Boyer College Electroacoustic Ensemble Project—BEEP—is a group for electroacoustic music creation in a collaborative environment. Founded in 2013 by Dr. Adam Vidiksis at Temple University, BEEP embraces a variety of aesthetics, from EDM to the avant garde. We function in varied modalities: from a laptop orchestra, to fusion of computers and traditional instruments, to an electronic music band. Our main goal as an ensemble is to explore new musical paths and new technologies by uniting people of varying and complimentary skill sets in the discovery of new possibilities of creating sound. BEEP also aims to promote expressive music making and musical vocabulary, increase technological literacy among its participants and audience, to encourage a culture of code literacy and computer competency hand-in-hand with critical and independent thinking, and to perform the ever-expanding repertory of electronic music. We believe that the integration of electronics in traditional music is one of many pathways forward for new music in our future. BEEP’s programming carries wide appeal, enjoyable for everyone from the seasoned electronics aficionado to the casual radio listener. We seek any audience with open ears and open minds.

####Matthew Goodheart
is a composer, improviser, and sound artist. Following an early career as a free-jazz pianist in the fertile San Francisco Bay Area, he has developed a wide body of work that explores the relationships between performer, instrument, and listener. His diverse creations range from large-scale microtonal compositions to open improvisations to immersive sound installations – all unified by the analytic techniques and performative methodologies he has developed to bring forth the unique and subtle acoustic properties of individual musical instruments. Goodheart’s approach results in a “generative foundation” for exploring issues of perception, technology, cultural ritual, and the psycho-physical impact of acoustic phenomena. His work has been featured across the US and Europe, and has won numerous awards and honors, including the 2014 Berlin Prize in Music Composition and a 2013 Fulbright Grant to the Czech Republic where he worked with the historic quartertone pianos designed by Alois Hába. He is currently faculty member in the Department of the Arts at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

####KEROAÄN
is a collaborative research project between **IAN M FRASER and REED EVAN ROSENBERG** exploring composition of electronic music by an artificial intelligence. Pieces are diffused in real time with no human intervention whatsoever as the machine agent manipulates the qualities of chosen non-standard synthesis and microsound techniques. In live diffusions, the machine agent additionally controls laser apertures and an array of strobe lighting which collectively act as a visual projection of the agent's internal state as it structures the performance. A distinctly non-human logic pervades the resultant arrangements of chaotic sounds and high-intensity lighting, presenting an immersive, alien environment.

####Matmos
is **M.C. Schmidt and Drew Daniel**, aided and abetted by many others. Currently based in Baltimore, the duo formed in San Francisco in the mid 1990s. Marrying the conceptual tactics and noisy textures of object-based musique concrete to a rhythmic matrix rooted in electronic pop music, the two are known for their highly unusual sound sources: amplified crayfish nerve tissue, the pages of bibles turning, liposuction surgery, rat cages, a cow uterus, snails, cigarettes, laser eye surgery, latex fetish clothing, life support systems, a five gallon bucket of oatmeal, and a washing machine. Matmos’ work presents a model of electronic composition as a relational network that connects sources and outcomes together; information about the process of creation activates the listening experience, providing the listener with entry points into sometimes densely allusive, baroque recordings. Matmos have released over ten albums on labels such as Matador and Thrill Jockey. They also have a history of rich collaborations with artists like Bjork, Antony, So Percussion, Terry Riley, The Kronos Quartet, David Tibet, Rachel’s, Zeena Parkins, and the Princeton Laptop Orchestra, Daria Martin, Young Jean Lee, and Ayman Harper. Outside Matmos, Schmidt and Daniel have also performed in Baltimore’s High Zero festival and engaged countless collaborators across the American underground and beyond for more than 20 years.

####Katarina Miljkovic
Composer Katarina Miljkovic investigates interaction between science, music and nature through collaborative musical performance. This interest led her to the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot’s essay *The Fractal Geometry of Nature* and self-similar complex structures resulting in the cycle, *Forest*, “…a dreamy piece, along the lines of Feldman or Brown…entirely captivating” *(Signal to Noise)*.  
In collaboration with *Wolfram Research*, Miljkovic has been working on sound mapping of the elementary rules from Stephen Wolfram’s New Kind of Science. She presented her exploration in this new field at Brown University, NKS conferences in 2004, Waltham, MA, Wolfram Technology Conference 2005, Champaign, Illinois, NKS 2006, Washington, D.C., NKS 2007, University of Vermont and 2009, University of Pisa, Italy, The Musical and Scientific Legacies of Iannis Xenakis, 2006, Toronto, the International Conference on Mathematics and Computation in Music, MCM 2007 and ECMST ~ MASA 2010, Berlin, Boston Cyber Festival, Cambridge Science Festival, Boston First Night,  Klangwerktage 2012, Hamburg, Harry Partch symposium, Boston, 2013 and 2017 Euro MicroFest in Freiburg. Her generative music has been described as “a refined, hypnotic dream” *(Danas)* “a work of musical and visual slow-motion with only a few delicately elaborated musical metaphors” *(Radio Belgrade)*. Her collaborative projects include works with Theater DAH, Belgrade, film director Vlada Petric, Harvard, video artist Milan Popovic, Belgrade, choreographers Dawn Kramer and Stephen Buck, and  Ko Ishikawa, Japan and Christopher Watford, NY.

####Roscoe Mitchell
has been an icon and leader in jazz music and contemporary music for over 40 years. An internationally renowned musician, composer, and innovator, Mr. Mitchell began his distinguished career in the spirited 1960s of Chicago, Illinois. His role in the resurrection of long neglected woodwind instruments of extreme register, his innovation as a solo woodwind performer, and his reassertion of the composer into what has traditionally been an improvisational form have placed him at the forefront of contemporary music for over four decades. A flagship in the field of avant-garde jazz and contemporary music, Mr. Mitchell is a founding member of the world renowned Art Ensemble of Chicago, the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM), and many music ensembles. Mr. Mitchell has recorded over 100 albums and has written hundreds of compositions. His compositions and improvisations range from classical to contemporary, from wild and forceful free jazz to ornate chamber music. Roscoe Mitchell has pursued a long lasting collaboration with [David Wessel (1942-2014)](http://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/inmemoriam/html/DavidL.Wessel.html) in free-form improvisational works featuring David's custom-designed controller/computer system alongside Roscoes instrumental developments. David and Roscoe gave historical duet performances in two previous Improtech Series Workshop-Festival : in 2004 during the [Sound and Music Computing Conference](smc04.ircam.fr) at Ircam, and in 2012 at the [Improtech Paris - New York](http://repmus.ircam.fr/improtechpny) Workshop.

####Bob Ostertag
Composer, performer, historian, instrument builder, journalist,
activist, kayak instructor, Bob Ostertag's work cannot easily be
summarized or pigeon-holed. He has published more than twenty
CDs of music, two DVDs, and five books. His writings on
contemporary politics have been published on every continent and
in many languages. Electronic instruments of his own design are at
the cutting edge of both music and video performance technology.
He has performed at music, film, and multi-media festivals around
the globe. His radically diverse collaborators include the Kronos
Quartet, postmodernist John Zorn, heavy metal star Mike Patton,
transgender cabaret start Justin Vivian Bond, British guitar
innovator Fred Frith, Quebecois film maker Pierre Hébert, EDM star
Rrose, jazz legend Anthony Braxton and many others. He is rumored to have connections to the
shadowy media guerrilla group The Yes Men. He is currently a
professor at the University of California at Davis.
Ostertag began his musical career in 1978, touring Europe with jazz great Anthony Braxton,
playing a keyboard-less modular analog synthesizer. He was not the first person to take a
modular synthesizer on stage, but he was the first person to center his musical practice in a
scene of “free improvisors” using a modular synth as his main ax.
In 1979 he settled in New York City and became a key part of the late 1970s “downtown”
scene along with John Zorn and Eugene Chadbourne. He left music for most of the 1980s and
immersed himself in the Central American revolutionary movements of the time. His goodbye
to the Salvadoran revolution, a composition titled “Sooner or Later,” is considered a classic of
electronic music.
His 2012 book (co-authored with Jane McAlevey) on labor unions in the US was named by
The Nation as “the most important book of 2012.”
The Wire called his previous book, Creative Life, “the most lucid philosophical work on music,
culture, and politics since Steve Reich’s Writings on Music.”

####Joseph Pfender
is a musicologist, composer, and writer. A PhD candidate at New York University, his research has focused on ways in which philosophy of technology and information theory have been incorporated into postwar modernism in musical and interarts practices. His dissertation considers the vernacularized dynamics of knowledge production in American science and technology, by exploring magnetic tape’s historical development from the late 19th-c onwards, analyzing its impact on avant-garde American composers beginning in 1947, and articulating tape’s effects on American artistic production during the Cultural Cold War. Building on experiences in previous fellowships in Shanghai and Hong Kong, he is thinking with scholarship by Lauren Flood, Anna Greenspan, Gabriele de Seta, and others, comparing the horizons of conceivability achieved by both a liberal neocolonialism of musical expression at mid-century, and music in new and febrile channels of global circulation today.

####Bhob Rainey
works with sound, both acoustically and electronically. He, like a lot of people, is interested in quite a few things, but he is especially invested in matters relating to consciousness - its possibilities, limitations, absurdities, threats and futures. As a result, ideas from philosophy, technology, psychology, and the plain old grind worm their way into his work. So do horror and humor. His music is visceral, sometimes. Thoughtful, sometimes. Sometimes both. Rainey is also a computer programmer, for real. If you use SuperCollider, you've probably tinkered with his plugins. If you're using this web site, you're using his code. That may seem trivial, but this is one of the only web sites where you can buy downloadable music, and all of the splits and royalties, etc., go immediately to all parties involved. Why this isn't normal is not clear. In any case, having an intimate knowledge of cutting edge technologies is helpful when both examing the possibilities they offer and putting forth a critique of their application, ideology, etc. He also plays the saxophone.

Praised for giving "smooth varnish" (Boston Globe) to his performances with a "clear consistent tone," Watford works to advance the instrument's relevance within diverse contexts. As a specialist in contemporary music, his performances transcend traditional practice to explore the limits of microtonality, extended techniques, improvisation and electroacoustics. His work with composers often investigates unfamiliar sounds and extreme sonic identities, with a specific dedication to the exploitation of the bassoon's acoustic peculiarities.  
Watford has worked closely with such leading composers as Salvatore Sciarrino, Pierluigi Billone, Tristan Murail, Franck Bedrossian, Christian Wolff, John Harbison, and Elliott Carter. He is a member of Boston's acclaimed new-music sinfonietta Sound Icon and has appeared with the NotaRiotous ensemble, Callithumpian Consort, A Far Cry, Nonce Ensemble, New England Conservatory’s First Monday series, the SEM Ensemble, and the Concord Chamber Music Society, among others, as well as solo performances in London at the UK Microtonal Festival and residencies at the Virginia Arts Festival and Boston University's Center for New Music.

####Mina Zarfsaz
is an interdisciplinary artist, designer and system thinker who works across the fields of art, philosophy, architecture, and design. Her work seeks to invert common tools and social control to create dialogue, exchange critical perspective, generate questions and ideally inspire a better understanding of what we perceive as reality and its representations. Zarfsaz’ work explores the nature of perception and the organization of the everyday in the world around us. Her work is part of a larger set of challenges to two ideas: we consider our bodies separate from our environment, and that our perception happens in our heads without requiring an enactive approach to the environment. In her procedural installations, the walking body is conditioned by the architecture where the body often gets involved in a series of imaging-along— walking around, bending, and situating in order to assemble or dismantle an expectation—that reconstitutes new perceptions, and thereby reinscribes new realities. Zarfsaz has attended Pratt Institute's MFA ComD program and received her MFA from Montclair State University in Studio Arts. She holds a BFA from State University of New York, a BA in Business Administration from University of Alzahra and an Interior Design Certificate from Tehran University. Zarfsaz currently lives and works in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and holds teaching appointments at Temple University, and Rowan University. Zarfsaz regularly works as a lecturer and workshop leader; her work has been shown in galleries internationally and across New York: Magnan Metz Gallery, Broadway Gallery, Times Square Museum, and New York State Museum to name a few. Her work is also featured in Artslant, NY Arts Magazine. In 2016, Zarfsaz joined the art collective Vox Populi in Philadelphia as a member and board of directors’ member representative. At Vox she focuses on curatorial and publications programming. She has been granted residencies at Vermont Studio Center and most recently at Icebox Project Space.
