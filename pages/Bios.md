<img src="../images/Bio_Roscoe.png" width="320" style="float:left" hspace="10">**Roscoe Mitchell** has been an icon and leader in jazz music and contemporary music for over 40 years. An internationally renowned musician, composer, and innovator, Mr. Mitchell began his distinguished career in the spirited 1960s of Chicago, Illinois. His role in the resurrection of long neglected woodwind instruments of extreme register, his innovation as a solo woodwind performer, and his reassertion of the composer into what has traditionally been an improvisational form have placed him at the forefront of contemporary music for over four decades. A flagship in the field of avant-garde jazz and contemporary music, Mr. Mitchell is a founding member of the world renowned Art Ensemble of Chicago, the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM), and many music ensembles. Mr. Mitchell has recorded over 100 albums and has written hundreds of compositions. His compositions and improvisations range from classical to contemporary, from wild and forceful free jazz to ornate chamber music. Roscoe Mitchell has pursued a long lasting collaboration with [David Wessel (1942-2014)](http://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/inmemoriam/html/DavidL.Wessel.html) in free-form improvisational works featuring David's custom-designed controller/computer system alongside Roscoes instrumental developments. David and Roscoe gave historical duet performances in two previous Improtech Series Workshop-Festival : in 2004 during the [Sound and Music Computing Conference](smc04.ircam.fr) at Ircam, and in 2012 at the [Improtech Paris - New York](http://repmus.ircam.fr/improtechpny) Workshop.
This Workshop and concerts are dedicated to the memory of David Wessel.

<img src="../images/Bio_Ostertag.png" width="320" style="float:left" hspace="10">**Bob Ostertag** : Composer, performer, historian, instrument builder, journalist,
activist, kayak instructor, Bob Ostertag's work cannot easily be
summarized or pigeon-holed. He has published more than twenty
CDs of music, two DVDs, and five books. His writings on
contemporary politics have been published on every continent and
in many languages. Electronic instruments of his own design are at
the cutting edge of both music and video performance technology.
He has performed at music, film, and multi-media festivals around
the globe. His radically diverse collaborators include the Kronos
Quartet, postmodernist John Zorn, heavy metal star Mike Patton,
transgender cabaret start Justin Vivian Bond, British guitar
innovator Fred Frith, Quebecois film maker Pierre Hébert, EDM star
Rrose, jazz legend Anthony Braxton and many others. He is rumored to have connections to the
shadowy media guerrilla group The Yes Men. He is currently a
professor at the University of California at Davis.
Ostertag began his musical career in 1978, touring Europe with jazz great Anthony Braxton,
playing a keyboard-less modular analog synthesizer. He was not the first person to take a
modular synthesizer on stage, but he was the first person to center his musical practice in a
scene of “free improvisors” using a modular synth as his main ax.
In 1979 he settled in New York City and became a key part of the late 1970s “downtown”
scene along with John Zorn and Eugene Chadbourne. He left music for most of the 1980s and
immersed himself in the Central American revolutionary movements of the time. His goodbye
to the Salvadoran revolution, a composition titled “Sooner or Later,” is considered a classic of
electronic music.
His 2012 book (co-authored with Jane McAlevey) on labor unions in the US was named by
The Nation as “the most important book of 2012.”
The Wire called his previous book, Creative Life, “the most lucid philosophical work on music,
culture, and politics since Steve Reich’s Writings on Music.”

<img src="../images/Bio_Ladonna.jpg" width="320" style="float:left" hspace="10">**LaDonna Smith** is an American violinist, violist, vocalist, teacher, and musical impresario. A veteran of the Alabama’s legendary Surrealist scene, she has spent four decades pioneering and promoting the field of free improvisation as an art-form capable of ecstatic and explosive emotions, clarity, lyricism and raw human expression. With her highly personal solo style of instant composition and extended techniques, Smith has enjoyed collaborations with fellow improvisers in hundreds of concerts across North America, Europe (including Russia and Siberia), China, Japan and India. Likewise, she has produced many festivals and concerts in her home territory of Birmingham, Alabama, serving as a local outpost for improvised music in the deep South. Co-founded with her longtime duo partner Davey Williams, her TransMuseq record label and The Improviser (an international journal of free improvisation) produced trailblazing documentation and discussion of the emerging free improv idiom. She has performed with Anthony Braxton, Peter Brotzmann, Derek Bailey, Evan Parker, Peter Kowald, Henry Kaiser, John Zorn, Andrea Centazzo, Dave Liebman, Anne LeBaron, Misha Feigin, Shaking Ray Levis, Rova Saxophone Quartet, and Susan Alcorn. Her discography includes recordings on Ictus, Tzadik, Table of the Elements, Leo Records, Meniscus, and Ishtar.

<img src="../images/Bio_SusanAlcorn.jpeg" width="320" style="float:left" hspace="10">**Susan Alcorn**. One of the world’s premiere musical innovators on her instrument, Baltimore-based Susan Alcorn has taken the pedal steel guitar far beyond its traditional role in country and western swing music. Known among steel guitarists for her virtuosity and authenticity in a traditional context, Alcorn first paid her dues in Texas country & western bands. Soon she began to expand the vocabulary of her instrument through her study of modern classical music (Messiaen, Varèse, Penderecki), the deep listening of Pauline Oliveros, Astor Piazzolla’s nuevo tango, free jazz, and world musics (Indian rags, South American songs, and gamelan orchestra). Her pieces reveal the complexity of her instrument and her musical experience while never straying from a very direct, intense, and personal musical expression. Though primarily a solo performer, Alcorn has collaborated with numerous artists including Pauline Oliveros, Evan Parker, Eugene Chadbourne, Peter Kowald, Chris Cutler, Ellen Fullman, Le Quan Ninh, Sean Meehan, Joe McPhee, LaDonna Smith, Mike Cooper, Jandek, Fred Frith, Maggie Nicols, and Mary Halvorson.

<img src="../images/Bio_Matmos_ by Josh Sisk.jpg" width="320" style="float:left" hspace="10">**Matmos** is M.C. Schmidt and Drew Daniel, aided and abetted by many others. Currently based in Baltimore, the duo formed in San Francisco in the mid 1990s. Marrying the conceptual tactics and noisy textures of object-based musique concrete to a rhythmic matrix rooted in electronic pop music, the two are known for their highly unusual sound sources: amplified crayfish nerve tissue, the pages of bibles turning, liposuction surgery, rat cages, a cow uterus, snails, cigarettes, laser eye surgery, latex fetish clothing, life support systems, a five gallon bucket of oatmeal, and a washing machine. Matmos’ work presents a model of electronic composition as a relational network that connects sources and outcomes together; information about the process of creation activates the listening experience, providing the listener with entry points into sometimes densely allusive, baroque recordings. Matmos have released over ten albums on labels such as Matador and Thrill Jockey. They also have a history of rich collaborations with artists like Bjork, Antony, So Percussion, Terry Riley, The Kronos Quartet, David Tibet, Rachel’s, Zeena Parkins, and the Princeton Laptop Orchestra, Daria Martin, Young Jean Lee, and Ayman Harper. Outside Matmos, Schmidt and Daniel have also performed in Baltimore’s High Zero festival and engaged countless collaborators across the American underground and beyond for more than 20 years.
