<img src="../images/Bio_Roscoe.jpg" width="200" style="float:left" hspace="10">**Roscoe Mitchell** has been an icon and leader in jazz music and contemporary music for over 40 years. An internationally renowned musician, composer, and innovator, Mr. Mitchell began his distinguished career in the spirited 1960s of Chicago, Illinois. His role in the resurrection of long neglected woodwind instruments of extreme register, his innovation as a solo woodwind performer, and his reassertion of the composer into what has traditionally been an improvisational form have placed him at the forefront of contemporary music for over four decades. A flagship in the field of avant-garde jazz and contemporary music, Mr. Mitchell is a founding member of the world renowned Art Ensemble of Chicago, the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM), and many music ensembles. Mr. Mitchell has recorded over 100 albums and has written hundreds of compositions. His compositions and improvisations range from classical to contemporary, from wild and forceful free jazz to ornate chamber music.
Roscoe Mitchell has pursued a long lasting collaboration with [David Wessel (1942-2014)](http://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/inmemoriam/html/DavidL.Wessel.html) in free-form improvisational works featuring David's custom-designed controller/computer system alongside Roscoes instrumental developments. David and Roscoe gave historical duet performances in two previous Improtech Series Workshop-Festival : in 2004 during the [Sound and Music Computing Conference](http://smc04.ircam.fr) at Ircam, and in 2012 at the [Improtech Paris - New York](http://repmus.ircam.fr/improtechpny) Workshop.
This Workshop and concerts are dedicated to the memory of David Wessel.

activist, kayak instructor, Bob Ostertag's work cannot easily be
summarized or pigeon-holed. He has published more than twenty
CDs of music, two DVDs, and five books. His writings on
contemporary politics have been published on every continent and
in many languages. Electronic instruments of his own design are at
the cutting edge of both music and video performance technology.
He has performed at music, film, and multi-media festivals around
the globe. His radically diverse collaborators include the Kronos
Quartet, postmodernist John Zorn, heavy metal star Mike Patton,
transgender cabaret start Justin Vivian Bond, British guitar
innovator Fred Frith, Quebecois film maker Pierre Hébert, EDM star
Rrose, jazz legend Anthony Braxton and many others. He is rumored to have connections to the
shadowy media guerrilla group The Yes Men. He is currently a
professor at the University of California at Davis.
Ostertag began his musical career in 1978, touring Europe with jazz great Anthony Braxton,
playing a keyboard-less modular analog synthesizer. He was not the first person to take a
modular synthesizer on stage, but he was the first person to center his musical practice in a
scene of “free improvisors” using a modular synth as his main ax.
In 1979 he settled in New York City and became a key part of the late 1970s “downtown”
scene along with John Zorn and Eugene Chadbourne. He left music for most of the 1980s and
immersed himself in the Central American revolutionary movements of the time. His goodbye
to the Salvadoran revolution, a composition titled “Sooner or Later,” is considered a classic of
electronic music.
His 2012 book (co-authored with Jane McAlevey) on labor unions in the US was named by
The Nation as “the most important book of 2012.”
The Wire called his previous book, Creative Life, “the most lucid philosophical work on music,
culture, and politics since Steve Reich’s Writings on Music.”
