### Presentations, demos, performances

####Intelligent Music Agents capable of joint intuitive and rational thinking
Jonas Braasch (RPI)  
This talk describes an intelligent music system approach that utilizes a joint bottom-up/top-down structure. The bottom-up structure is purely signal driven and calculates pitch, loudness, and information rate among other parameters using auditory models that simulate the functions of different parts of the brain. The top-down structure builds on a logic-based reasoning system and an ontology that was developed to reflect rules in jazz practice. Two instances of the agent have been developed to perform traditional and free jazz, and it is shown that the same general structure can be used to improvise different styles of jazz.

####Live Scoring for Computer Assisted Composition
Justin Yang	(RPI)  
This talk explores the use of networked computer animation as a front end for composition and scoring for live performers. An assortment of computer animated graphic tools can be used to develop interactions between algorithms and AI, and live performers. These tools help open the door for possibilities such as real-time scoring, structured improvisation, multi-nodal composition, real-time orchestration, and performer-computer interactions.

####Reembodied Sound and Algorithmic Environments for Improvisation
Matthew Goodheart (RPI)  
Reembodied sound is a form of electroacoustics that uses transducer-driven resonant objects to create acoustic realizations of sample and analysis derived mixed synthesis. This talk will focus on the use of reembodied sound as a generative basis to create large-scale, algorithmically driven sonic environments for improvisers, discussing both technical implementation and aesthetic orientation. Directions for future research involving digital listening agents and interactivity will also be addressed.

Mediation between Musicians and Code with Neural Networks	Jeremy Stewart	RPI	For this talk, we will discuss design and implementation of a neural network system for performance between acoustic musicians and live coding performers. Starting with simple classification systems and experimenting with data for training deep neural networks, while also considering novel integrations into existing performance systems, we will outline our current work while also discussing potential steps forward.

Drexel MET Lab overview	Yougmoo Kim, Jeff Gregorio	Drexel	Drexel ExCITe Center / The Music and Entertainment Technology Laboratory (MET-lab) at Drexel University is devoted to research in media technologies shaping the future of live performance and entertainment. Founded in 2005, the lab's research is ever evolving, currently focusing on the following areas:

Trumpet + Personal system	Sarah Reid	CalArts	Trumpet + Personal system
Heavy gurgle of electric fissues	Joo Won Park	Wayne St.	Joo Won Park (b.1980) wants to make everyday sound beautiful and strange so that everyday becomes beautiful and strange. He performs live with toys, consumer electronics, kitchenware, vegetables, and other non-musical objects by digitally processing their sounds. He also makes pieces with field recordings, sine waves, and any other sources that he can record or synthesize.
Spatial constructs and concepts, rituals	John Mallia / Scott Deal	NEC studio	John Mallia lives and works in Boston, where he is a member of the Composition Faculty, and directs the Electronic Music Studio, at the New England Conservatory of Music. His compositional process is informed by spatial constructs and concepts, and a fascination with presence, ritual, and the thresholds standing between states of existence or awareness. In addition to composing chamber music and works combining acoustic instruments with electronics, he creates fixed media compositions, and collaborates with visual artists on multimedia works, including installation.
